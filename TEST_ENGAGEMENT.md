## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Happens When You Use It:
1. **Browser Opens**: A Chrome window will open (you'll see it)
2. **Auto-Login**: Puppeteer logs into LinkedIn
3. **Navigate**: Goes to the post URL
4. **Perform Action**: Clicks like/comment/share
5. **Close**: Browser closes automatically

### Security:
- ✅ Credentials are NOT stored
- ✅ Used only for the current session
- ✅ Browser closes after action

### LinkedIn Limitations:
- ⚠️ Don't use excessively (max 50-100 actions/day)
- ⚠️ LinkedIn may detect automation
- ⚠️ Use at your own risk
- ⚠️ Violates LinkedIn Terms of Service

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Browser not opening"
```bash
# Install Chromium manually
cd server
npx puppeteer browsers install chrome
```

### "Login failed"
- Check credentials are correct
- LinkedIn 2FA is not supported
- Try logging in manually first

### "Selectors not found"
- LinkedIn changed their HTML
- Update selectors in `server/services/linkedinAutomation.js`

---
